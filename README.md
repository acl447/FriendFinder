# Friend Finder

Find your best friend match with this app! Click on "Go to Survey", answer the survey questions and click "Submit". The app will show you the friend who, out of the other people who have taken the survey, has the greatest compatibility with you. You'll see the friend's name and picture. 

Technologies used to make this app are Bootstrap, Node, Heroku, Express, CSS, HTML, Git, JavaScript and JQuery.

To make this app I began by designing the app with Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. Then I added code to connect to my express server. I used JavaScript and JQuery to outline my HTML and API routes and to compare the survey answers of different people who have taken the survey. I used a Bootstrap modal to show the resulting match.
